# Violet Crystal is a Rust crate for rust-powered MCBE addon development (Still in development)

### Avaiable features:
- Pack generation
- Item creation (all of the components are there!)
- Script support (pairing a folder with js scripts with the pack)

### Plans:
- Blocks;
- Entities;
- Animation / Render controllers;

### Progress:
- Recipes, done:
  - Shapeless
  - Furnace

I started this project only to learn Rust, but I'll be really happy if someone would actually use it.
