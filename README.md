# Violet Crystal is a Rust crate for rust-powered MCBE addon development (Still in development)

### Avaiable features:
Pack generation
Item creation (about all of the components are there!)

### Plans:
Blocks
Entities
Animation / Render controllers

I started this project only to learn Rust, but I'll be really happy if someone would actually use it.
